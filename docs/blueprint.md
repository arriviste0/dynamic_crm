## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light periwinkle (#D1D9FF), a calming color reflecting trust, aligned to software UIs; contrasting well with dark text; also suggesting insight, important to a data-driven app.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F7), nearly desaturated, to focus user attention on the content, following dark color scheme.
- Accent color: Lavender (#E6E6FA), a light, de-emphasized variant on purple, providing delicate emphasis; analogous to periwinkle and nearly desaturated; suitable for secondary actions and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern, objective look, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, consistent icons from 'lucide-react' to represent objects, actions, and modules. Follow the flat design style and maintain a uniform stroke weight for all icons, for consistency with the image provided.
- Employ a consistent grid layout with adequate spacing and padding to ensure a clean, organized, and user-friendly interface. Follow the layout exemplified in the provided image: left navigation, top search, KPI cards, charts, and activity feeds.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations for interactive elements, such as button hover states and page transitions, to enhance the user experience. Example: slight scaling or color changes on hover.
